\lettersection{Why me and About Me}
My love to understand things in deeper levels always ended up the same way, tearing down things. Initially I struggled to fix it back. Like any other engineer, my life also started with reverse-engineering. Physics classes and Internet Evolved me, fixing things back became easier. I started to modify things ranging from toys to Motorcycles. Things around me evolved, I started learning , I started iterating , building.I started exploring new things to do.The passion for going Fast got me to Motorcycles.I started modifying my 2-stroke bike for better performance and reliability.I wanted to push the limits. The first electric bike i rode was a huge revelation for me. I was pretty clear electric mobility was the next big thing after the 100 year old IC-engines.All this was before my Bachelor’s degree.Engineering, as a professional course helped me to get my roots deeper. After that I had clear idea to make all my moves carefully ranging from Final year projects to Internship at Keltron to International internship at Germany funded by DAAD. My first Job is also related to this, India's First Swappable Battery and the SWAP and Charge Station(Sunmobility Quick Interchange Station). I'm Still Learning.Always interested in Electric-vehicle , 2-strokes , Autonomous cars and safety Systems , quad-copters and all things Hardware and Software.
