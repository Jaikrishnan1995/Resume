My love to understand things in deeper levels always ended up the same way, tearing down things. Initially I struggled to fix it back. Like any engineer, my life also started with reverse-engineering. Physics classes and Internet Evolved me, fixing things back became easier. I started to modify things ranging from toys to Motorcycles. Things around me evolved, I started learning , I started iterating , building.I started exploring new things to do.The passion for going Fast got me to Motorcycles.I started modifying my 2-stroke bike for better performance and reliability.I wanted to push the limits.Engineering as a professional course helped me to get my roots deeper.After that i had clear idea to make all my moves carefully ranging from Final year projects to Internship at Keltron to International Internship at Germany funded by DAAD. My first Job is is closely connected to Electric vehicle ecosystem, India's First Swappable Battery and SWAP Station.I'm Still Learning.
